# BookJP Reader

This is a program to read books on PC.

### Why does this program exist?
There are several reasons I decided to create it. 
First and foremost I have studied Java for a while and the best way to study a new programming language is to write something in it.
The other reason is that I like reading books on my PC and I miss some features (e.g. smooth autoscrolling).

### The main features of BookJP Reader
* It is free.
* It is cross-platform (it is Java).
* It has the ability to smoothly scroll text.
* There is an autoscroll option with speed adjustments.
* It can read plain text (different encodings), fb2 and html files.
* It is portable - all settings are saved in the same directory as the program.

### What are current limitations
* The program doesn't support images and is currently limited to txt, fb2 and html formats.

### Requirements
To use this program you need to have Java 8.
It uses JavaFX so you may need to install it as well (it isn't always preinstalled on some systems along with Java).

### How to start it
There are runnable jar files in the target directory.

### License
The program is licensed under the terms of GPL 2.0 license.

This program is using Jsoup library (https://jsoup.org) to parse HTML files which is
